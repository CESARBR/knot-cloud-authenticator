      "message": "UUID is as unsecure as the e-mail. Only the combination of UUID+token poses a security risk. I could use the e-mail instead of UUID, but UUID provides a direct search later at /reset. If I use the e-mail, I must search for devices with a given e-mail and then verify if that device was properly signed (because one could create another device with the same e-mail). As I already have the UUID now, I decided to use it (the user won\u0027t have to deal with this information).\n\nWould it be better to change to e-mail?",
